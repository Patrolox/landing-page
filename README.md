# Landing Page

This is my version of a [landing page](https://patrolox.github.io/landing-page/) based on The Odin Project guidelines.

It was my first real contact with web development. Thanks to this exercise I got familiar with creating a webpage using html and css. Topics I covered:

- what are and how to use flexboxes;
- how to style pages;
- basics of using Git and Github.
